# ITalk Blog

Welcome to ITalk Blog, a full-stack web application where I experiment with a variety of technologies and best practices to create a blogging platform. This project has been a fun and educational journey where I've implemented features like creating and editing posts, managing favorite authors, and liking and bookmarking posts.

## Technologies Used

ITalk Blog is built using a stack of modern technologies:

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Express.js and Node.js for the server.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing data.
- **Forms:** React Hook Form for efficient form management.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for predictable state management.
- **API Queries:** Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for efficient data fetching.
- **Security:** All routes are protected to ensure data security.
- **Admin Functionality:** User roles, including admin features.
- **Best Practices:** Following industry best practices for clean code and maintainability.

## Features

- **Create and Edit Posts:** You can create and edit your own posts, sharing your thoughts with the world.
- **Manage Favorite Authors:** Easily add authors to your list of favorites to stay updated with their content.
- **Like and Bookmark Posts:** Show your appreciation by liking posts, and bookmark your favorite posts for later reference.
- **Protected Routes:** User authentication ensures that all routes are secure.
- **Admin Features:** Additional administrative functionality for managing content and users.

## Note

As a pet project, there are certain limitations. For instance, image storage is currently using URL links because the disk storage is not paid for (sorry about that!). Feel free to experiment with the project and make it your own.
